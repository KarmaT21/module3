              Who are Digital Natives?<br>
What could be the possible reasons of children doing better than their parents do to work on with the digital technology? If you have a child, think of them. Have you ever taught them how to operate mobile phones, tabs, laptops, phablets, and so on? Alternatively, who else is teaching them?  The only answer is ‘they are known as digital natives including those born after 1980s. What about those born before 1980? They are known as digital immigrants. It is just like the native speakers and non-native speakers of English. 
Techopedia defines “digital natives” as those born after 1980 following the introduction of digital technology. They are said to be surrounded by technology often from their early childhood or otherwise ‘born into it’. Therefore, the natives are more likely to be familiar with the terminology of the digital world, interacting regularly with technology themselves. This idea is being supported from the practical environment, where present day children pick up how to operate television, mobiles, laptops, etc. without the instructions from their parents. 
Those born before 1980 are considered as the digital immigrants. These are the people who hate digital technology and said to be less quick to pick up new technologies. They need someone to guide them to operate digital equipment such as mobile phones, television, etc. If they are the teachers, they would use handwritten notes to teach their students and avoid using PowerPoint presentations or any other digital media. Even if they have to use technology, they need to seek assistance from the digital natives.
